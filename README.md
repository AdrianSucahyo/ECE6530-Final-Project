## Introduction
The Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) is a signal processing technique which is able to transform time domain signals into the frequency. This lab explores the applications of the DTFT in the context of FIR Filter Design and Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency Signaling.

## DTMF

Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency Signaling is an encoding scheme that utilzes two different tones in order to encode data. Using tones to encode rows and columns on a grid, the overall encoding and decoding can be used to transmit a phone number.

The application shown in the MATLAB script demonstrates the synthesis, filtering, spectral analysis, and decoding associated with DTMF. There are no special considerations needed to run the program. Note: There may be audio so be weary heaphone users.
